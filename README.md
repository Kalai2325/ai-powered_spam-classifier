AI BASED DIABETES PREDICTION SYSTEM
USING GRADIENT BOOSTING ALGORITHM

Diabetes is a prevalent and chronic medical condition that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Early and accurate prediction of diabetes risk is crucial for preventive healthcare and timely intervention. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool for predictive analytics in the field of healthcare. This study presents an AI-driven approach to diabetes prediction, utilizing machine learning algorithms, extensive patient data, and electronic health records.

National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases. The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, their BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age, Outcome(0,1). Machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and deep neural networks, are employed to process this data and establish a robust predictive model for diabetes risk assessment.

The AI-driven diabetes prediction model demonstrates promising results, with a high degree of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. This model can aid healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes, allowing for early intervention and tailored prevention strategies. Furthermore, it empowers patients to make informed decisions about their lifestyle and healthcare choices, contributing to better diabetes management.

In conclusion, this research showcases the potential of AI in improving diabetes prediction, underscoring the importance of data-driven healthcare approaches for the betterment of patient outcomes and the overall healthcare system. The findings presented here open doors to further research and the implementation of AI-powered diabetes prediction tools in clinical settings.
